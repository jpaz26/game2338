## Summary
This game is based on the well known card game Magic The Gathering, a deck building game where players collect cards and create decks based on those cards or the playstyles those cards support. There are cards that are for offense and just put out damage on players and their cards. You have defensive cards that can nullify or counter spells toward other players. There are a number of possible card combinations players to come up with. For myself, I'm an offensive player so I have a deck that is just for combat trying to put out as much damage as I can on the other player.
This game does a fantastic job transferring the game from the table to computers. Players can choose their avatar based on characters from the games lore and are given starter packs as a base to work from. I was given two decks one all green mana and one all white. Going into player turns the steps are fairly simple. Players have a hand of 7 cards and play a mana card, which allows players to play other cards that have a mana cost. Next the player will play a if they have the mana for that cards cost. After the players plays all the cards they want to they can either enter combat phase or pass their turn. The combat in this version of the game will give the player step by step instructions when in combat phase and will point to cards they can attack or the other players avatar.
Now when you win a game of Magic the game will award the player in game currency which in turn can be used to buy more packs of cards when the player goes to the games in game store. Once a player buys a new deck they can go to the decks page and open it to see what cards they've gotten. A player could spend hours on here making all different decks they want according to the number of cards they might own. Of course once you've created the deck you want, you can then take it to play other players and test it out. Magic: Arena is a great way to learn about the game as a whole if you're new or interested in the game. It's free to download and play, and the only microtransatactions are buying the other form of currency to unlock card packs faster.
## Final Thoughts
What I personally like most about the game is the fact that it's free, so other people interested in learning about the game cant try it out. Its fairly user friendly with an easy to navigate game menu and a considerabel amount of card content. The game itself can be a bit of a grind when saving money for more packs but players can always change their decks with what they have if they get bored. I also personally dislike that it is only a one vs one multiplayer right now. I would like for the game to include more players in their multiplayer.
