I give this game a 10 out of 10

## Summary
The setting of this game takes place in a futuristic setting where humanity has discovered alien technology of the planet Mars
and proves the existance of alien life. The discovery of this technology propels mankind's by hundreds of years. While space travel
mankind stumbles upon an alien race known as the "Turians" and triggers what is known as "The First Contact War". Years later after the
war end mankind is given a place within the alien united nations.

We find ourselves starting the game years later as the prominant Commander Shepard, who the player will customize. Customization features
include: changing gender, facial features, hair and eye color, battle scars, classes, and a backstory which in certain dialogues throughout
the game will be brought up. The games first mission takes you to a planet to secure an alien artifact, however the mission becomes
complicated as an enemy force known as "The Geth" led by a rogue special forces alien, who works directly with the alien council, and is
named "Saren". While playing through this mission the player will learn the mechanics of the game. The game is a cover based third person
shooter along with a strong narrative and dialogue choices. Players will have two companions who will accompany them on missions and
exploration. As an RPG the game gives experience points for completing objectives, defeating enemies, and certain dialogue choices.
Expanding the games character customization, players will be able to change weapons and armor for the main character as well as their
companions.

Mass Effect also encourages exploration which will be done through the games main hub, "The Normandy". Players can select planets to travel
to and explore with the "Mako" land vehicle. Going back to the story, during the first mission Commander Shepard comes in contact with the
alien artifact and is given a vision showing the death and destruction of the long extinct alien race known as "The Protheans". This vision
was also given to Saren, who Commander Shepard is one step behind, but neither can make sense of it. It is up to Commander Shepard to
capture Saren and bring him to the council for questioning however as the player progresses they will learn that Saren is attempting to
summon a race of sentient machines known as "Reapers", whose sole purpose is to eradicate advanced life in the galaxy to maintain order.
It is at this time the player will attempt to foil Sarens plans and keep the reapers from reaching the Milky Way.

## Final Thoughts
What I enjoy most about this game is the story and lore behind it. It does a great job giving information about the universe and races
you encounter. The mechanics can be a little stiff when taking cover and aiming to shoot down enemies. The companions you encounter
throughout the game are wonderfully written and voiced, you come to feel for the characters as if they were real friends. My least
favorite feature is the planetside exploration in the land vehicle. Environments are often barren and devoid of life leaving the player
to drive around aimlessly.
