## Summary
Doom is more than just running and gunning down demons. In this latest installment from Bethesda and ID software they give players the ability to go beyond the story of the game and create their own stories and adventures in the new Snapmap game and level editor. Players can create a myriad of maps and game modes from a simple run and gun to a tower defense or even memorization games. Snapmap was made to be easy to use with the player in mind so they can feel like a creator.
Snapmap is known to be one of the easiest map editors to be released to players. Lets start of with Snapmap modules. They are practically broken up map pieces that players can literlly "snap" together like a couple of lego pieces. Once the player has a base they can start putting objects like explosive barrells, weapon pickups or even enemies themselves.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
