## Summary
  Doom is more than just running and gunning down demons. In this latest installment from Bethesda and ID software they give players the ability to go beyond the story of the game and create their own stories and adventures in the new Snapmap game and level editor. Players can create a myriad of maps and game modes from a simple run and gun to a tower defense or even memorization games. Snapmap was made to be easy to use with the player in mind so they can feel like a creator.
  
  Snapmap is known to be one of the easiest map editors to be released to players. Lets start of with Snapmap modules. They are practically broken up map pieces that players can literlly "snap" together like a couple of lego pieces. Once the player has a base they can start putting objects like explosive barrells, weapon pickups or even enemies themselves. After that players can then work on the logic of the map giving objects and map pieces actions or floating texts and really bring the map together. Snapmap makes players feel like they're creating their own game.
  
  Snapmap also supports multiplayer for up to four players. So players can make maps and games based around multiple players. Going back to the tower defense game that was made using Snapmap is a good example of all the features brought together. It supports four players, it has a currency system so players can purchase weapons and upgrades between rounds. The enemies spawn in on timers and can be set on a specific path and can respond to what players use when defending. Barricades and hazards are good examples, the enemies could have commands in response to them. Snapmap is a completely versatile mode that extends the quality of life for DOOM so players won't be bored when they beat the story.

## Final Thoughts
I really like how versatile this editor can be and the ease to use it. Players feel like they're creating something they can be proud of and share it with other players to try. Even if someone isn't the creative type there is always something someone has created for them to try out and be inspired by. Of course there will be limitations to what Snapmap can't do. For example someone recreated harvest moon using Snapmap, however there is only so much the player could do with what the game is programmed for. You can't import anything for modding which I would count as a downside of the mode.
