## Summary
This game is a tactical multiplayer/hero shooter that pits 10 players against eachother on teams of five. Players begin the match by choosing a position to defend or for attackers a spawn point. Then players choose the operator they want to play as and choose their loadout. Different operators are used for different roles with their special tools. After players spawn in the game defenders must set up the area they are defending while attackers use drones to find and identify the defending team. Attackers can even place drones in key postions, if they havnen't been destroyed yet, to get a vantage point on the defending team.
Now that we've talked set up, lets talk match gameplay. After the setup phase attackers now are on foot and are able to enter the building. Oh and one other thing... This is a one life game, but we'll discuss that in a bit. Knowing that players must be methodical about their moves and the sound they make. The attackers just got to the objective and must take it but walls and doors are reinforced. Attackers must now blast their way in whether from the doors or use an operators special tool to blow through the reinforced. A firefight breaks out and players are finally dying but they aren't out of the game. They can use cameras or drones to call out enemy positions to help their teammates that are still alive.
Now that we know the gameplay lets talk operators. The game does a really wonderful job offering different operators for different situations and continue to update the game with new ones at differnt periods through the year. Some are made to blow holes through reinforced walls and doors, jam technology, or even track enemy players. There are 50 playable operators right now and with more to come, so this game isn't short on variety. Some weapons are operator specific so not all can use the same weapon. Players can change atatchments on these wepons to fit their playstyle.
## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
