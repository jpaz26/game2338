## Summary
This game is a 6 player multiplayer shooter where four players take on the role of divers following an underwater dron on a set path collecting treausre while trying to survive the other two players who take on the rolls of sharks. The divers start the game choosing what equipment and weapons to bring into the match and the other players choose what species of shark they are going to play as. Yes, there are more than one species of shark you can play as. There are 9 species of sharks to choose froma and unlock they range from the Bull Shark to the Great White Shark. Players can also choose and unlock different divers. This game also offers alot of cosmetic items to choose from such as weapons skins, diver skins, and shark skins. One of my favorite shark skins is the zombie shark skin.
Going into the gameplay, it is based exactly on diving mechanics. Players can swim up and down, side to side, and forward and back. As the match goes on divers earn money from treasure or damage or kills agains enemy sharks. With this money they buy more equipment that makes the fight easier or better weapons. The sharks earn points to evolve and gain abilities and buffs.
Now this game wouldn't be a multiplayer shooter if it didn't have multiple game modes. The modes offered are Blood and Gold, where players escort STEVE the drone to collect treasure and must survive til the end or when player tickets run out. Hide and Seek, which a survival mode for divers against the sharks. The last game mode, and in my opinion the best game mode, is Megaladon Hunt where players have the chance to play as the megaladon and in order for the other player to become the megaladon the must kill the current one.
## Final Thoughts
I like that this game can be loads of fun if you have a really good group to play with as well as all the different cosmetics the game offers so you can make your diver and shark the way you like them. The different game modes offer variety so you and your friends can play for hours without really getting bored and you want to try to unlock all the sharks as well. However there are times where it feels like the sharks can be overpowered to where alot of the time sharks win most of the matches I played. My main takeaway from the game however is that its a unique game in a world full of shooters.
