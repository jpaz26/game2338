Game Testing Concepts for Halo 3

Functional Testing:
Everyday when workers came in the spent the first few hours testing the games basic functions. They would test if characters spawned in correctly, if the level would load, and tested movement and combat mechanics. These are performed daily to verify if any changes to games code in other sections havent affected these functions. Whitebox testing.

Playtesting:
The developers would hold playtesting scenarios with players to get a better idea of how they would play the game help them narrow down any issues they havent come across yet. With many people playing the game at once it would give developers a better understanding where and what players were having issues. Blackbox testing.

Balance Testing:
After playtests were conducted the developers would go back and check the areas that players were having trouble with. They would have heat maps to show all the locations players died to see if those areas needed tweaking making it easier for players to advance. They would even have clips associated with the heat spots to give a visual as to what happened. Blackbox testing.

Load Testing:
This testing was done to verify if the game could handle a large number of players on a network playing together. They tried connecting to developers in Japan to tes this and even conducted automated tests to simualte such a scenario. Blackbox testing.

Stress Testing:
This is one of the most commonly known tests. Developers would intentionally perform functions in the game repeatedly to try and break the game to acomodate what players do themselves when they play the game. One example they used was "what if a player wants to play the entire game witha just a sword". They would hav to test everything th sword does in numerous ways so the game wouldnt break if the player hit something just that one last time. whitebox testing.

Usability Testing:
Developers would have one person come in from outside the company and test the game to see what they did and how they experienced the game.One tester commnented on how he liked how smart the AI was noting how they didnt do the same thing twice. Blackbox testing.
