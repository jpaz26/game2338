## Details



### Trackmania Turbo




### Rating
I rate games out of 5 points and I give this game a 4 out of 5 points

## Summary
Trackmania is a fast and fun arcade racer which implements a variety of ideas and mechanics that makes it its own racing game seperate from
the big name racers such as Need for Speed and the Forza series. Being a storless game, it offers many things to players to keep them coming
back for more races and try to beat those records. The game shows lists of leaderboards for players to see who and what their records are
giving players personal goals for themselves. The track editor allows players to even make bring their own ideas to life for other players
to enjoy and try to master.

The game offers a four player splitscreen multiplyer for couch competitive racing and online multiplyer where 100 players race against the
the clock. They appear on the players screen as "ghost" cars, seeing as the player never collides physically with them. It makes for a fun
experience however seeing the other racers themselves run into certain track obsticles.

Lastly this game does not short itself on content. Before players make their own tracks, the game already comes with 200 tracks created by
the developer. This will certainly keep players busy for a long while. My personal favorite tracks are the beach tracks. The scenery is
just pleasant to see while traveling at high speed and trying not to fall into the water and ruin my time.

## Final Thoughts
My final take away from the game was great driving mechanics everything felt responsive. However not all cars drive the same, which is to
to be expected of a racing game but other cars could feel clunky and really loose. I also like how the game itself scratches that competitive
itch. Whether it be witht the racing against other players or just trying to beat "DarthVader1's" record on a specific track.
