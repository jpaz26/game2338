## Summary
Based on the world famous board game Monopoly comes the the new and updated video game representation from EA. Just like board game the
rules are about the same. Players will roll dice to determine how far their pieces will move. If the player lands on a property the first
time around they have the chance to purchase it will in turn earn them money from other players that land on that same property. You stil
go straight to jail should you land on that spot or pull the card from the chance deck. we also can't forget to collect that handy $200
when we pass go.

This version of Monopoly however offers a new mode that makes games go by faster than previous versions. This game mode is called "Richest"
mode and it was created to streamline games. Classic monopoly is known to take days to finish, so you can see how an online multiplayer
monopoly can't really afford that. Each round of Richest begins with a roll of four dice and a mini-game competition these mini-games, 
like the simple fare found in Nintendo's Mario Party series, take only about a minute to play and are each based around some basic 
controller commands like bending the analog sticks to the proper angle, or moving a cursor around the screen and pressing a face button 
simultaneously. The winner of the mini-game then gets first pick of the four rolled dice, and earns the same number of tokens to place 
on the board as the number of dots displayed on the chosen die. 

This party-remix mode may seem confusing to begin with, and it can be since it throws almost all of the standard Monopoly rules out and 
just retains the barest foundations of the game. But after a few rounds, its appeal reveals itself and its fun factor kicks in. Its mix of 
demanding both mini game skills and strategic thinking about the board itself edges close to the same sense of satisfaction you get from 
succeeding in Mario Party.

## Final Thoughts
I like the new mode in this version due to its speed factor making multiplayer games more fun and a little chaotic in my opinio. As before
I compared it to Mario Party another fun party game for you and your friends. However if you play the classic mode the pacing is a whole
different story. The game will drag on and come to a standstill when players look into their accounts when its their turn. My final thought
take away from the game however, is still a fun game to play with friends and ea does a good job transferring the boardgame into the 
virtual world.
