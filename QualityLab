Darksouls:

- reliability: The game is very responsive to whatever the user presses when it comes to gameplay mechanics. For example the dodging enemy
attacks or attacking the enemies themselves.

-efficiency: I find the game to be efficent due to how much goes on in the game world itself its not a very hardware heavy game due to how
little is happening at once on a level.

-usability: As far as learning how the game works it does very well teaching the player core mechanics as the game has attack buttons a
dodge button and use button its fairly simple.

Halo: Combat Evolved

-reliability: Halo tends to reliable along the lines of camera movement for being a first person shooter, as well as the shooting mechanics

-efficency: For a game that requires fast reflexes the game runs fairly smooth with all the animations, and projectiles that appear on the
screen.

-usability: The game has simple aim and shoot mechanics as well as jumping in which the first mission of the game teaches the player.

Monster Hunter World:

-reliability: This game requires players to attack and dodge monsters on a consistent basis. With that in mind the gameplay mechanics are
not only smooth but can be chained together to pull off combos

-Maintainablity: I find this game to be maintainable based on the constant updates the game receives from the developer as well as their
communication with the games fanbase.

-interoperability: This game is marketed as team/multiplayer game so it is going to connect on a network for players together. Due to this
fact the develpoer has dedicated servers which do a great job maintaing player connection.
